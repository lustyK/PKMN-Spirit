<p><i>My dreams are fevered, and my thoughts grow dimmer each day...hours...hours are all i have left...before the Dark.</i></p>
<p>Nearly two decades have passed since Cinnabar's split. In Indigo City, one man's desperate efforts to avert disaster for a region have stopped the bleeding, but the deepest wounds never fully heal. Soon, latent conflict will return and the challenge of peace will be endured by a younger, stronger generation of trainers. Living the in Kanto has never been so difficult, yet strong wills and free spirits are all that's needed to shape the future.</p>
<p><i>There is no secret. There is no shortcut. The quickest path to success is to confront your failures. And move forward.</i></p>

<p>Hi, this is Lusty, the primary writer for the narratives of PKMN Spirit. While writing this near-future story of Kanto, I’ve struggled to find balance within the scope of the narrative. I strived for a game that is, at it’s core, enjoyable to play, but also grounded in its character relationships; reasonable, yet, at times, suspended from reality. Since the advancing of character relationships was at the forefront of my mind, most of the writing focuses on individual's successes and failures within those relationships, and their potential for redemption. I trust that each characters decisions are clear and their choices resonate in some way with players; a number of set pieces were conceived with the direct intent of stretching that trust to the breaking point. The story isn’t perfect, but, in some way, that reflects the design of imperfect characters, who are constantly trying to rebuild their broken nation and find strength against internal angst. My intent is that empathy, furnished by a compelling narrative, finds each player in some insightful way, and provides a glimpse into the lives of characters navigating this new, fractured world.
