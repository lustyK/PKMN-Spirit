<p><i>My dreams are fevered, and my thoughts grow dimmer each day...hours...hours are all i have left...before the Dark.</i></p>
<p style="color:goldenrod">Nearly two decades have passed since Cinnabar's split from the region, after Celadon turned to ash, Cerulean washed away and chaos engulfed Saffron. In Indigo City, one man's desperate efforts to avert disaster for a region have stopped the bleeding...but deep wounds never truly heal.</p>
  
<p style="color:goldenrod">Soon, latent conflict will return and the challenge of peace will be endured by a younger, stronger generation of trainers. Life in Kanto has never been so difficult; yet, strong wills and free spirits are all that's needed to shape the future, and preserve unity amidst chaos.</p>

<p><i>Boundaries have been broken and the forces revealed now flow freely into our world...the past has a way of coming back to haunt us.</i></p> 
<p style="color:goldenrod">Hi, my name's LustyK, the creator of Pokemon Spirit. I spent the better part of a year writing this near-future story of Kanto and, after working on map making and dialogue, spriting and eventing, I feel ready to recruit some help!</p>

<p style="color:goldenrod">The main story line focuses on the relationships of a few key characters, some navigating a new chapter in their lives, others working towards the completion of lifelong goals. There are no gym leaders to fight in this game; indeed, the notion of a "gym leader" has been restructured to mean "governor" in this alternate, post-RBY universe of Kanto. Instead, an intricate story line has been weaved into the fabric of the region, including key events on the horizon. Many characters, both new and old, with populate this narrative.</p>

<p style="color:goldenrod">In Indigo City, a bastion for all of Kanto's citizens, the Academy has graduated its first trainers: 22+ year old students who are now qualified to own "personal" Pokes, and find their purpose in Kanto. The player will navigate the main story arc from this lofty start, which allows considerable freedom along the way, including side-story completion, frivolous exploration, or in-depth research on new Pokes and the last two decades of Kanto's war-torn history.</p>

<p style="color:goldenrod">The story isnâ€™t perfect, but, in some way, that reflects the design of imperfect characters, who are constantly trying to rebuild their broken nation and find strength amid internal doubt. My intent is that empathy, furnished by a compelling narrative, finds each player in some insightful way, and provides a glimpse into the lives of each character as they navigate this new, fractured world.</p>

<p><i>I loved my city and my family...but he took those from me. I don't want your promises, and I don't want your protection...I want revenge.</i></p> 
<p style="color:goldenrod">Every major city has been reworked, some even removed, depending on how they were affected by the events 20 years prior: Celadon, a ruin of ash and sand, its lush forests now ruled by desert winds; Cerulean, stagnant and sunken, turned to swampland and re-birthed in the feral northeast; Saffron, previously Kanto's largest city, split in two, and weary of hope, as the Citadel looms to the south, seeking it's reclamation. Great care has been taken to increase the scale and complexity of each city, while preserving character and vision.</p> 

<p style="color:goldenrod">Old pokes will return along with the new! Unique event pokes, carefully selected "character" pokes, and a few novel creations will populate the region. I do not plan on adding all 800+ pokes to the game, a promise that always seemed as impractical to me as it was unnecessary. Rather, pokes will be selected based on how well they serve the narrative, the characters, and the environment in which they thrive. Old pokes may have new moves, abilities or even evolutions! But knowledge of these changes will always be available to those curious enough to seek the answers...</p>

<p style="color:goldenrod">I made this post to, hopefully, recruit a few dedicated people interested in either what I've been developing, or experimental design in general. I have mapped out most of the cities by hand already, and have concepts for each route. The best case scenario for me would be finding an artist to bring the story to life with their own unique style. Since the story is, at it's core, an experiment into (hopefully) unique Pokemon fan-game storytelling, I would want the art to be of similar caliber, and would be willing to give complete control to someone who can match that expectation.</p>

<p style="color:goldenrod">Other than that, anyone interested in assisting with eventing, general spriting or testing should feel free to send me a message. Any and all help would be appreciated!</p>
